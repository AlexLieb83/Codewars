// What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array?

// addLength('apple ban') => ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
// addLength('you will win') => ["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]

// Your task is to write a function that takes a String and returns an Array/list with the length of each word added to each element .

// Note: String will have at least one element; words will always be separated by a space.

//first split the string into an array, then map over the array, returning the word then the word.length
function addLength(str) {
  return str.split(' ').map(w => `${w} ${w.length}`)
}



// Find Mean

// Find the mean (average) of a list of numbers in an array.
// Information

// To find the mean (average) of a set of numbers add all of the numbers together and divide by the number of values in the list.

// For an example list of 1, 3, 5, 7

// 1. Add all of the numbers

// 1+3+5+7 = 16

// 2. Divide by the number of values in the list. In this example there are 4 numbers in the list.

// 16/4 = 4

// 3. The mean (or average) of this list is 4

//first we use reduce to get the sum of the numbers in array, then divide by the length of the array.
var findAverage = function (nums) {
  return nums.reduce((acc, c) => acc + c, 0)/nums.length
}
